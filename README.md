# odin-etch-a-sketch

This project is a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

It can be changed between normal mode and random mode.

Normal mode will change the color of the grid when you hovering over it from white to black.

Random mode will random the color of the first grid then will add 10% of black to it until it'll be completely black after 10 passes. Then random the color again.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated.
